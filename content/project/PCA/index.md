<p> In this project I implemented <b>L2 regularized principal component analysis (PCA)</b> in <code>python</code> by only using <code>numpy</code>. The PCA algorithm is then applied to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (BCW) data set to reduce the number of variables needed to give an accurate breast cancer diagnosis. </p>

<p> There's probably mistakes here and there, but given that at the time I was a Psychology PhD student in my first year and quite unfamiliar with python, I am pretty happy with how the project turned out and that's why I keep it here.</p>
