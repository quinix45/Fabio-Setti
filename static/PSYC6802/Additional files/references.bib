Functions for analyzing data at multiple levels include within and between group statistics, including correlations and factor analysis. Validation and cross validation of scales developed using basic machine learning algorithms are provided, as are functions for simulating and testing particular item and test structures. Several functions serve as a useful front end for structural equation modeling. Graphical displays of path diagrams, including mediation models, factor analysis and structural equation models are created using basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book on psychometric theory as well as publications in personality research.
